# Noether's Theorem Animation with Manim

This repository contains a Manim script to create an educational animation explaining Noether's Theorem, a fundamental concept in physics that connects symmetries to conservation laws. The animation is designed to be both knowledgeful and engaging, with clear explanations, mathematical derivations, and visual examples.

## Project Overview
Noether's Theorem states that there is a corresponding conserved quantity for every continuous symmetry in a physical system. This project uses Manim (https://www.manim.community/), a mathematical animation library, to create a video that:
- Introduces Noether's Theorem and the concept of symmetry.
- Provides a step-by-step proof, including the action, Euler-Lagrange equations, symmetry transformations, and the Noether current.
- Use animations to illustrate examples of symmetries (e.g., time symmetry → energy conservation, spatial symmetry → momentum conservation).
- Concludes with a summary of the theorem's importance and a celebratory particle animation.

The animation is structured into six scenes:
1. **Introduction**: Introduces Noether's Theorem.
2. **What is Symmetry?**: Explains symmetry with a rotating circle.
3. **Theorem Statement**: States Noether's Theorem and its historical context.
4. **Proof**: Derives the theorem with mathematical rigor.
5. **Examples**: Shows various symmetries and their conserved quantities with visuals.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizes the theorem's significance with a fun animation.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.7+**: Manim requires Python 3.7 or higher.
- **Manim Community Edition**: The animation library used in this project.
- **FFmpeg**: Required for rendering videos.
- **LaTeX (e.g., MiKTeX)**: Needed for rendering mathematical equations.

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/noethers-theorem-manim.git
   cd noethers-theorem-manim

2. Set up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Manim:
   ```bash
   pip install manim

4. Install FFmpeg:
   - On Windows: Download from FFmpeg's official site (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your PATH.
   - On macOS: brew install ffmpeg
   - On Linux: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg (Ubuntu/Debian) or equivalent for your distribution.

5. Install LaTeX:
   - On Windows: Install MiKTeX (https://miktex.org/download).
   - On macOS: brew install mactex
   - On Linux: sudo apt-get install texlive-full (Ubuntu/Debian) or equivalent.

6. Verify Installations:
   ```bash
   manim --version
   ffmpeg -version
   pdflatex --version

## Usage
1. Render the Animation:
   - To test in low quality (faster rendering):
     ```bash
     manim -pql noethers_theorem.py NoethersTheorem
   - To render in high quality (1080p, 60fps):
     ```bash
     manim -pqh noethers_theorem.py NoethersTheorem

2. Output Location:
   - The rendered video will be saved in:
     media/videos/noethers_theorem/1080p60/NoethersTheorem.mp4

3. Clear the `media` Directory (if needed):
   - To start fresh and avoid conflicts with previous renders:
     ```bash
     rm -rf media

## File Structure
noethers-theorem-manim/

├── noethers_theorem.py  # Main Manim script for the animation

├── media/               # Directory where rendered videos and assets are stored (auto-generated)

└── README.md            # This file

- `noethers_theorem.py`: Contains the Manim script with the `NoethersTheorem` class, which defines the animation scenes.
- `media/`: Automatically generated by Manim to store rendered videos, images, and other assets.
